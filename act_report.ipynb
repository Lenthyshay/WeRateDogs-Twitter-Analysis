    "<br>In my analysis, I examined WeRateDogs's archive through August 1, 2017. Most of the necessary Twitter data was provided by Udacity. In addition, Udacity ran the images on WeRateDogs's account through a neural network to generate three predictions for each image. After wrangling the data for original content with images, I wanted to answer the following questions:\n",

    "- What are the Top 10 breed of dogs tweeted about?\n",
    "- What dog breed got the highest retweet and favorite interactions?\n",
    "- What is the correlation between ratings and the interactions by Twitter users?\n",
